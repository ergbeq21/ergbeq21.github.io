		GAMEPLAY            :

Garena Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game played in third person perspective.

A battle royale match consists of up to 50 players parachuting onto an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position and take weapons and supplies to extend their battle life.

When players join a game, they are in a plane which flies over an island. While the plane is flying over the island, the players can jump wherever they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on the island with a maximum of 50 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing the surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.
RECEPTION     :
The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid- and low-specification phones", but a reviewer stated that "if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds. But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun with your friends, you should definitely play."

Tais Carvalho of TechTudo commented that Free Fire "prioritizes performance, making it a great choice for any type of device. The gameplay stands out and has enough content to entertain and offer rewarding combat." Regarding the progression of characters and skills, she said it is "a flashy add-on."
In the Google Play annual list of "Best Apps of the Year", Free Fire won in the "Best Popular Vote Game" category of 2019, being the most publicly voted in Brazil and in Thailand.

	GAMEPLAY     :
In PUBG: New State, 100 players are deployed by jumping out of a plane on a remote 8x8 island called TROI, the game's main map, to collect supplies and battle each other as they fight to survive with the last one becoming the winner. TROI is set in the year 2051 in the northern United States, with a futuristic environment, buildings, architecture and monuments. [6] New features include drones, ballistic shields, neon sights, combat balancing ability, reviving dead teammates, and "recruiting" downed enemies. [7] Vehicles include futuristic cars, buggies, motorcycles, speedboats and gliders. PUBG: New State will feature interactive objects and structures with destructible windows and doors, being able to intersperse between a first (FPP) and third (TPP) person perspective. It will feature weapon customization with different firing mode selections, grenade launchers, grips, sights, silencers, and other types of accessories that can be equipped and selected on different weapons.
DEVELOPMENT     :
In February 2021, PUBG Studios, an internal division of Krafton (the same company that publishes the game), announced the development of game codenamed "PUBG: NEW STATE", a sequel and separate entity to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and its version mobile , set in the near-future (year 2051) as a part of the PUBG Universe.[9]

In July 2021, Krafton reported that the game surpassed 20 million pre-registrations on the Google Play alone.[10] On 28 August the Alpha testing has concluded after conducting in 28 countries and the developers implemented improvements and fixes based on feedback from participating users.[11][12] In September 2021, since the pre-registration has started for iOS, the game has surpassed more than 50 million pre-registrations combined on both Google Play and App Store, beating a record of pre-registrations and assuming this a success for Krafton before launch.

According to Krafton, the game will include "state-of-the-art rendering technology" to enhance graphics and lighting to a new generation of mobile games without affecting performance, and it will include a realistic and enhanced Battle Royale, similar to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

<h5>2.Programming</h5>
<img class="programfoto" src="programing.jpg">
<p class="tret">Eines meiner größten Hobbys ist das Programmieren.Ich habe mit 11 Jahren mit dem Programmieren angefangen.Ich habe viele Programmiersprachen gelernt und auch das Programmieren in der Schule gelernt.Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a particular task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.asks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs.These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand.
